          At Floom we’re proud to be bringing the local florist experience
          online, reminding people just how special it is to both send flowers
          and have flowers delivered to you. We aim to combine a beautiful to
          look at, easy-to-use and flexible flower delivery service with the
          spark and magic that only the most passionate and skilled local
          florists can bring to a bouquet. We handpick every florist that we
          work with to ensure they share our values and our commitment to
          providing amazing online flower delivery experiences. When you order
          flowers online, we don’t believe you should simply be a last-minute
          gift choice (though our same-day flower delivery option does help with
          that!). Flowers at their best can truly excite the senses, whatever
          the occasion, whatever the location: from Mother’s Day flowers in
          Bristol to Valentine’s Day flowers in London. Every item that you see
          on our site is utterly unique to the local florist who crafts it,
          which means it will also be unique to the sender and loved one who
          receives it. We don’t believe in providing our florists with generic
          guidelines, instead, we let them create bouquets based on nature’s
          seasonality and their own creative instincts. We’re truly ambitious in
          our aims to build a global community of flower lovers, florists, and
          wholesale flowers, spreading floral joy is what we’re all about! We
          try to give our community as many opportunities to send flowers with
          the majority of our florists offering same day flower delivery,
          perfect for those last-minute gifts.
